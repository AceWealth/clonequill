# Clone Quill
## It's quill like note web application.
In the old days, there was a web service called quill.to(Powerd by livedoor.com).
It was a note light as a feather.
I was love it, but the service has ended abruptly.
Able to reproduce similar functionality by using the Dropbox is the purpose in this project.
Because it was created through Google Translate, this English has become quite strange to English. Please note.
